# Mastering Reactive JavaScript
This is the code repository for [Mastering Reactive JavaScript](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-reactive-javascript?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786463388), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
The book starts with the basics of reactive programming, what Reactive Extensions is, and how can you use it in JavaScript along with some reactive code using Bacon. Next, you’ll discover what an Observable and an Observer are and when to use them. You'll also find out how you can query data through operators, and how to use schedulers to react to changes.

Moving on, you’ll explore the RxJs API, be introduced to the problem of data traffic (backpressure), and see how you can mitigate it. You’ll also learn about other important operators that can help improve your code readability, and you’ll see how to use transducers to compose operators.

At the end of the book, you’ll get hands-on experience of using RxJs, and will create a real-time web chat using RxJs on the client and server, providing you with the complete package to master RxJs.
